New Zealand (Aotearoa) is an island country located in the south-western Pacific Ocean, near the centre of the water hemisphere. It consists of a large number of islands, estimated around 600, mainly remnants of a larger land mass now beneath the sea. The two main islands by size are the North Island (or Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (or Te Waipounamu), separated by the Cook Strait. The third-largest is Stewart Island (or Rakiura), located 30 kilometres (19 miles) off the tip of the South Island across Foveaux Strait. Other islands are significantly smaller in area. The three largest islands stretch 1,500 kilometres (930 miles) across latitudes 34° to 47° south.[1] New Zealand is the sixth-largest island country in the world, with a land size of 267,710 km2 (103,360 sq mi).[2]

New Zealand's terrain ranges from the fiord-like sounds of the southwest to the sandy beaches of the far north. The South Island is dominated by the Southern Alps while a volcanic plateau covers much of the central North Island. Temperatures rarely fall below 0 °C or rise above 30 °C and conditions vary from wet and cold on the South Island's west coast to dry and continental a short distance away across the mountains and near subtropical in the northern reaches of the North Island.

About two-thirds of the land is economically useful, the remainder being mountainous. The vast majority of New Zealand's population lives on the North and South Islands. The largest urban area is Auckland, in the north of the North Island.

The country is situated about 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles) south-east of Australia across the Tasman Sea,[3] its closest neighbours to the north being New Caledonia, Tonga and Fiji. It is the southernmost nation in Oceania. The relative proximity of New Zealand north of Antarctica has made the South Island a gateway for scientific expeditions to the continent.
