Uganda is located in eastern Africa, west of Kenya, south of South Sudan, east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and north of Rwanda and Tanzania. It is in the heart of the Great Lakes region, and is surrounded by three of them, Lake Edward, Lake Albert, and Lake Victoria. While much of its border is lakeshore, Uganda is landlocked with no access to the sea.

The country is mostly plateau with a rim of mountains.[1]

The climate is tropical and generally rainy with two dry seasons (December to February, June to August).[1] It is semiarid in the northeast.[1]
