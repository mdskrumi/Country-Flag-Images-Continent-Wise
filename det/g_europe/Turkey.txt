Turkey is situated in Western Asia (Anatolian and Armenian highlands) (97%) and the Balkans (3%),[1] bordering the Black Sea, between Bulgaria and Georgia, and bordering the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, between Greece and Syria. The geographic coordinates of the country lie at: 39°00′N 35°00′E

The area of Turkey is 789,962 km2 (305,006 sq mi);[2] land: 770,760 km2 (297,592 sq mi), water: 9,820 km2 (3,792 sq mi). It has an Exclusive Economic Zone of 261,654 km2 (101,025 sq mi).

Turkey extends more than 1,600 km (994 mi) from west to east but generally less than 800 km (497 mi) from north to south. The total area (of about 783,562 km2 (302,535 sq mi)) consists of about 756,816 km2 (292,208 sq mi) in Western Asia (Anatolian peninsula and Armenian Highland) and about 23,764 km2 (9,175 sq mi) in Southeastern Europe (Thrace).

Anatolia (Turkish: Anadolu) is a large, roughly rectangular peninsula, situated in western half of Asiatic Turkey, while Armenian Highland (Turkish: Ermeni Yaylası) occupies its eastern part and includes mount Ararat, the highest peak of Turkey. The Asiatic part of Turkey accounts for 95% of the country's area.[3][4]

Anatolia is also known as Asia Minor or the Anatolian Plateau. The term Anatolia is most frequently used in specific reference to the large, semiarid central plateau, which is rimmed by hills and mountains that in many places limit access to the fertile, densely settled coastal regions. In Turkey, the term "Anatolia" often refers to the entire Asian part of the country.

The European portion of Turkey, known as Thrace (Turkish: Trakya), encompasses roughly 3%[1] of the total area but is home to more than 10% of the total population. Istanbul, the largest city of Thrace and Turkey, has a population of 11,372,613. Thrace is separated from Anatolia (the Asian portion of Turkey) by the Bosphorus (Turkish: İstanbul Boğazı), the Sea of Marmara (Turkish: Marmara Denizi), and the Dardanelles (Turkish: Çanakkale Boğazı); which collectively form the strategic Turkish Straits that link the Aegean Sea with the Black Sea. Mount Ararat, Turkey's tallest mountain with an elevation of 5,137 m (16,854 ft), is the legendary landing place of Noah's Ark and is located in the far eastern portion of the country.
