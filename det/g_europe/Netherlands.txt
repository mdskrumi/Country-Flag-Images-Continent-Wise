The geography of the European Netherlands is unusual in that much of its land has been reclaimed from the sea and is below sea level, protected by dikes. It is a small country with a total area of 41,545 km2 (16,041 sq mi)[1] and ranked 131st. With a population of 17.4 million[2] and density of 521/km2 (1,350/sq mi) makes it the most densely populated country in Europe (except for tiny city states like Monaco, Vatican City and San Marino), and the 12th most densely populated country in the world, behind only three countries with a population over 16 million. Consequently, the Netherlands is highly urbanized.
